## [0.3.0] - Unreleased

### BREAKING - Major Architecture Refactor

- Introduce typed Semantic and Lowered communication IR.
- Separate operation, output contract, wire format, and algorithm.
- Keep compressed FullTensor wire quantized through both collectives.
- Introduce compile-once/run-many and unified Work/Event/WorkspaceLease semantics.
- Move DDP, ReducedShard, and qWD training state into explicit adapters.
- Add typed CUDA P2P, fixed device metadata, dynamic quantized all-gather,
  native collective facade, and general ring/tree/hierarchical lowering.
- Add rank-local FP32 master-shard and qWD adapters with checkpoint-forced
  full-precision refresh.
- Remove the legacy public API, `restore_mode`, ParaScale-specific plugin,
  compatibility wheels, and obsolete old-API tests/examples.
- Package only `lowbit_comm` and the reviewed package-local CUDA source assets.
